== Description ==

Welcart is a program made in Japan, which assists you to build e-commerce system on Wordpress.

It has not only simple shopping cart function but also other functions necessary to run your store, such as "Order management function" and "membership function".
Welcart corresponds to various types of Wordpress template. 8 wedgets included in the program will help your blog to become an online shop.

= Cart system =

A cart responds to the complex sales; the sales of multiple items each of which you require individual selections of specific conditions. Also, "duties pack discount" function makes it possible to set different prices for supplier purchase.

Furthermore, it has many other functions useful for your store. For example, you can have "Membership system", "selection of shipping condition", and grant "special benefit" to your customers.

= Admin screen =

Orders made on online shop will be transmitted to manager by e-mail. At the same time, orders will be registered in database so that you will be able to check their details on order management screen. On the order management screen, you can edit contents of customer's order. You can send various e-mails such as estimate, confirmation of changes, shipping, from order screen by just clicking icons. This system reduces business burden of manager.
